  <p>It's Movember and time to make a difference.</p>
  
  <p>Men's health is a cause we're passionate about. Our commitment is to grow a mustache for the month of November and by changing our appearance, raise vital awareness and funds men's health, specifically prostate and testicular cancer initiatives.</p>

  <p>This year we are selling a limited edition T-Shirt to raise funds. With a purchase, you are not only supporting a great cause, but you also get a really cool T-Shirt.</p>

  <p>Thanks,<br/>- Team Stachesquach</p>
